// CTH adapter over @sinanagency/intake transcribeAudio.
//
// Thin shim: hands the OpenAI key from CTH's environment to the intake
// primitive and returns the transcript. Intake is fully tenant-agnostic;
// this adapter is the place where CTH-specific concerns (which key, which
// default model, future tracing/quota plumbing) get wired in.
//
// Opt-in. No current caller. Lives here so the future "talk to human" /
// vendor-support lane (voice notes from vendors → text we can store) can
// import a stable CTH-local entry point without reaching across packages.
