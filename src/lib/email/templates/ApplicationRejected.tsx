      <Paragraph>Hi {contactName},</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Thank you for applying to trade at Young at Heart Festival 2026 with{' '}
        <strong>{businessName}</strong>, and for your patience while our selection committee
        worked through every submission.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        We received an overwhelming number of vendor applications this year, far beyond the
        spaces we have available. After a careful and fair review, we are not able to offer{' '}
        {businessName} a trading spot at this year&apos;s festival.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Please know this is not a reflection of your business. With limited stalls and so many
        strong applications, many wonderful vendors could not be accommodated this time.
