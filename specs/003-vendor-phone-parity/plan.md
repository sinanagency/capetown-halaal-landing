# Spec 003 — Vendor phone parity ("everything on the portal, on the phone")

Status: PLAN (locked decisions, not yet built). Tier 1.

## Goal
A vendor can do every portal function from WhatsApp. No feature is web-only that
a vendor would reasonably want from their phone.

## The parity rule (the core decision)
Both the portal and the bot call the SAME `lib/` functions — parity is structural,
not duplicated. Each function is reachable on the phone by ONE of two paths:

- **EXECUTE inline (bot does it):** reads + simple scoped writes.
- **DEEP-LINK (bot hands a one-tap pre-authenticated link to the exact page):**
  money / legal / complex-form actions, which complete on the surface built for them.

Decision rationale: nothing relies on fragile chat form-filling, in-chat card
capture, or chat-based legal signatures (the failure/risk modes). Reads reuse
proven generators; simple writes use the audited scoped `updatePortalState`
pattern; risky actions reuse the exact web flow via a deep link.

## Capability map (portal function -> phone path)
EXECUTE inline:
- Overview/status, payment status            (Q&A, already)
- Invoice PDF            -> lib/payments/invoice-pdf.ts -> sendMedia
- Contract PDF           -> lib/contract/render-pdf.ts  -> sendMedia
- Documents status+files -> portal-state + vendor-docs bucket -> sendMedia
- Announcements          -> announcements lib -> text
- Resources (files)      -> resources -> sendMedia
- Marketing images       -> portal/marketing PNG generators -> sendMedia
- Floor map / my stand   -> map image -> sendMedia
- Staff list (view)      -> portal-state.staff -> text
- Profile text edits     (already: update_profile)
- Logo / photo upload    -> media-in (webhook already captures) -> set logo/gallery
- Support note           (already: post_support)
- Notification prefs     -> updatePortalState
- Resend a staff badge   -> staff/resend lib fn

DEEP-LINK (one-tap magic link to the page):
- Pay the fee            -> /portal/payments  (PCI page; already link-style)
- Sign contract          -> /portal/contract  (legal e-sign ceremony)
- Accept terms           -> /portal/terms
- Add staff badge        -> /portal/staff      (multi-field + WooCommerce order/money)
- Stand-change request   -> /portal/stand/change

REMOVED from bot:
- publish/hide stall (mandatory / auto-shown — no vendor toggle)

WEB-only by nature:
- password set/reset (auth ceremony) — but "resend my login link" IS a bot action
- the card-entry payment page itself (covered by the pay deep-link)

## Build phases (each phase ships working + walled)
**Phase 0 — foundations**
- Confirm/extract shared lib fns for: documents, announcements, resources,
  marketing, staff (invoice + contract already lib). No logic left only in routes.
- NEW primitive: `magicDeepLink(applicationId, path)` — short-lived (e.g. 15 min),
  single-use, signed, bound to vendor.id; a verify step logs the vendor in to that
  page. This is the one new AUTH surface -> gets the adversarial skeptic pass
  (TTL, single-use, scope, signature, no widening) before ship.
- Meta: submit ONE UTILITY template `vendor_portal_action` (body var + URL-button
  var) for OUT-OF-SESSION deep-link / "doc ready" notices. In-session sends need
  no template.

**Phase 1 — remove stall toggle + read/fetch suite** (biggest parity win, lowest risk)
- Remove publish/hide stall from vendor-brain (intents, classifier, handler, facts).
- Add scoped read handlers (reply via sendMedia/text): get_invoice, get_contract,
  get_documents, get_announcements, get_resources, get_marketing, get_map,
  get_staff_list, payment_status. Each bound to identity.vendor.id.
- Golden-set eval + walls per handler.

**Phase 2 — simple writes**
- logo/photo from sent image, notification prefs, resend badge. Scoped + idempotent + walls.

**Phase 3 — deep-link handoffs** (money/legal/complex)
- pay, sign contract, accept terms, add-staff, stand-change: bot replies with the
  one-tap magic deep link to the exact page. Bot composes; web completes.

**Phase 4 — onboarding + cleanup**
- Vendor login: one-time walkthrough listing every function + "you can also do all
  of this on WhatsApp." Seen-flag in portal-state (no DDL).
- Remove the admin-portal demo (locate exact artifact at build; not the vendor map-demo).

**Phase 5 — verify + ship**
- /backend-verify (curl) each handler; adversarial skeptic on the magic-link;
  deploy via vercel --prod; soak. ADR for execute-vs-deeplink + the magic-link.

## Isolation / safety (carry-over, non-negotiable)
- Every bot handler hard-bound to identity.vendor.id (the proven wall).
- Deterministic action routing; LLM for understanding only.
- Magic-link: short TTL + single-use + signed + vendor-scoped.
- CTH_VENDOR_ACTIONS flag still gates the whole action surface (instant off).

## Open at build (decide in-flight, non-blocking)
- Exact admin "demo" artifact to remove (locate in Phase 4).
- Whether "mandatory stall" also means defaulting public publish_stall=on for
  confirmed vendors (display-layer change, separate from the bot).
