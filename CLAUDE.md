# Cape Town Halaal 2026

The festival website and vendor portal layer for Cape Town Halaal / Young at Heart 2026. Two domains, one Next.js app, FooEvents for ticketing on WordPress upstream.

Stack: Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Vercel (deploy target), Supabase (vendor portal), WooCommerce + FooEvents (ticket source of truth), GoDaddy SMTP (vendor email), public stalls.json for the map.

Mission: ship the 2026 festival site at cthalaal.co.za and youngatheart.co.za, run the vendor application + portal layer on top of FooEvents without rebuilding what FooEvents already does for free, and never break the ticket purchase path.

## The doctrine governs everything

This project obeys CTH-DOCTRINE (the eight laws below). Before any change, read the laws that touch your surface. After any change, verify against them. No "done" without proof attached.

## The eight laws

1. Deploy-target law. This project ships through `vercel --prod` from the project root, on the configured Vercel project (capetown-halaal-landing). The stray netlify.toml and .netlify folder in the repo are a red herring left over from an earlier attempt; never run netlify deploy, never link a Netlify site, never wire a Netlify hook. One repo, one Vercel project, one driver. If a session smells like a parallel driver is open, stop and confirm.

2. Vendor-data-privacy law. Vendor names, phone numbers, addresses, stall codes, payment status, and admin notes never leak to public pages. Public pages render only what the vendor has marked public (logo, brand name, category, allocated stall code if and only if the vendor's status is confirmed). All other vendor reads go through an authenticated server context or RLS.

3. FooEvents-no-fork law. FooEvents charges 0% on this build. Do not rebuild ticket purchase, ticket delivery, attendee records, or PDF tickets. Layer on top through reads from WooCommerce or the FooEvents PDF theme path. If a feature requires forking FooEvents to ship, stop and surface the tradeoff to the operator before writing code.

4. Ticket-source-of-truth law. WooCommerce orders + FooEvents attendee records are canonical for tickets sold, attendees registered, and ticket PDFs. Halo never stores a duplicated ticket count. Any dashboard counter reads from the WC API at request time or from a clearly labeled cached snapshot with a fetched_at timestamp.

5. Email-throttle law. GoDaddy SMTP throttles aggressively. Every batch send uses maxMessages: 20 to recycle the SMTP connection. Every batch send is idempotent, resumable, and logs sent + remaining. If a throttle hit occurs, append the incident (date, batch, count, mitigation) to docs/throttle-log.md. Resend is the preferred outbound channel for vendor blasts; GoDaddy SMTP is for confirmation emails only.

6. Date-filter law. WooCommerce orders API returns all-time orders by default. Every orders.list call in this codebase passes the `after=` date filter scoped to the current festival year (2026 cycle). A call without `after=` is a defect. The doctrine-reviewer blocks any new caller missing this filter.

7. No-em-dashes law. Every vendor-facing email, every confirmation, every web copy string, every CMS field uses commas, periods, colons. No em-dashes. No en-dashes used as sentence breaks. LLM-generated copy is filtered or re-prompted before send.

8. Stall-allocation law. Allocations are stored as `⟦STALL:code⟧` markers on vendor_applications.admin_notes. There is no stalls table in this Supabase project, and DDL is blocked because the CTH Supabase lives on a different account. Never introduce a phantom stalls table in code that assumes DDL access. The map renders from /public/stalls.json. Allocation conflicts (two vendors on one code) surface as an over-confirm guard alert.

## The canonical files

CTH-DOCTRINE in this CLAUDE.md (the constitution).
package.json (deploy target, scripts).
vercel.json or Vercel project settings (the only deploy contract).
public/stalls.json (the map).
docs/throttle-log.md (append on every SMTP throttle incident).
lib/woocommerce.ts (every WC call here; date-filter enforced at this layer).
lib/email.ts (sender, throttle, maxMessages config).
app/portal/ (authenticated vendor surfaces; RLS contract).
.env.local and Vercel env (the secret map, never committed).

## How to work

Each module gets its own CLAUDE.md when it grows past a single file (lib/CLAUDE.md, app/portal/CLAUDE.md, etc.). Load only what you need. Invoke the doctrine-reviewer sub-agent before claiming done.

## Hard rules at this layer

Deploy through `vercel --prod` only. Ignore the netlify.toml. Vendor PII off public pages. Do not fork FooEvents. WooCommerce wins for tickets. Email batches use maxMessages: 20 and log throttle hits. Every orders.list call uses `after=`. No em-dashes anywhere vendor-facing. Stall codes only as markers on admin_notes; no phantom DDL.

## When in doubt

Read the law. Run the doctrine-reviewer. Confirm the deploy target. Confirm the WC date filter. Show proof. If a law seems wrong, write an ADR proposing the change. Do not silently violate.
